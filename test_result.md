The application still functions properly with the Windows 11 UI styling intact. All main UI sections (Hero, Stats Cards, Quick Start, Practice by Domain, Study Plans) display correctly without any server status warnings or notifications. The application is still making server health checks in the background (as seen in console logs), but no longer displays the offline notification to users."
